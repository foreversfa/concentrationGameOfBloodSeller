# concentrationGameOfBloodSeller
This is a site I build for Chany as her final project of Graphic Design.
Here is the url:\n

This is a concentration game. When you flip two cards with the same pattern, the cards will stay active; otherwise, they will be flipped back. \n
Every time player makes a mistake, one blood drop will be emptied. The game will end when player loses all his blood. \n
Every card is a distinct story. Each success will print the story to the right hand side. \n
Secret ending: certain order will lead a secret ending! \n
Have fun :)
